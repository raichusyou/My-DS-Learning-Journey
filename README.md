# My Data Science Journey
A place to document my portfolio, learning resources, and write a monthly journal on steps I've taken to become a competent Data Scientist / Python Programmer.

## About me (WIP)

**Background:** 

In my journey to find a niche I can devote myself to, I've gone over many different paths on what I can do make an impact on this world I live in. From my early childhood aspirations to become an astronaut to my current devotion to being better at understanding my world through data, visualizations, and storytelling, I've explored many different various career paths. 

Post-college life (WIP)
 
I have been more interested in simplifying complex data into an easy-to-understand way through data visualization and storytelling. In my personal life, I've been fascinated by stories that are told through data and interesting visualizations. (WIP)

As of the start of this repo (December 2019), I am enrolling in a part-time Data Science course from General Assembly. Hopefully this journal can be a way to document how far I've come in the future and show others a path in pursuing this field. 


## Journal (WIP)
December 2019 (TBD)

## Projects (WIP)
